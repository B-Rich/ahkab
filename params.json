{"name":"Ahkab","tagline":"a SPICE-like electronic circuit simulator written in Python","body":"### Ahkab\r\nThis project aims to develop a SPICE-like electronic circuit simulator. The code should be easy to read and modify, the main language is Python and it is platform-independent.\r\n\r\n\r\n### News\r\n\r\n* (21/08) Hi GitHub! The project moved from the old storage at Google Code to GH.\r\n* ahkab can now be run stand-alone with a netlist file or within Python scripts as a library. This will likely become the preferred way in the future, but there are no plans to discontinue the command line interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe code is released under GPLv2.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nGiuseppe Venturini (@ggventurini)\r\nI.T.
